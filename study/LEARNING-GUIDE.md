## 💬 Common Questions

### "This is too hard!"
**Normal!** AI is complex. Take breaks. Re-read sections. Focus on understanding concepts, not memorizing details.

### "I don't get the math"
**That's OK!** Focus on the analogies and concepts. You can understand AI without understanding all the math.

### "How deep should I go?"
**Your choice!** 
- Want to use AI? → Focus on Weeks 1, 3, 4
- Want to understand AI? → Do all 4 weeks
- Want to research AI? → Continue to advanced chapters

### "Should I code along?"
**Recommended but not required!**
- Week 1-3: Just reading is fine
- Week 4: Definitely try hands-on
- Later: Modify code when you're comfortable

### "What if I forget everything?"
**Normal!** That's why we:
- Have index for reference
- Include quick summaries
- Provide self-check questions
- Keep documentation accessible
